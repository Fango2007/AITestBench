# Requirements Checklist: LLM Server Test Harness & Benchmark Dashboard

**Purpose**: Release-gate checklist to validate requirements completeness,
clarity, consistency, and measurability across API, CLI, dashboard, security,
and performance.
**Created**: 2026-01-06
**Feature**: /Users/Fango/DEV/Projects/codebase/AITestBench/specs/001-llm-server-test-harness/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based
on feature context and requirements.

  decisions? [Clarity, Spec §FR-026]

  (parameter resolution order and persisted snapshot)? [Consistency,
  Spec §FR-059..FR-064]
- [x] CHK015 Are API requirements aligned with CLI requirements for all actions
  (list/run/export/reload)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-027..FR-029]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK016 Are acceptance scenarios for each user story independently
  testable with measurable outcomes? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [x] CHK017 Do success criteria map to measurable metrics (latency, p95, counts)
  without ambiguity? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-007]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK018 Are primary flows specified for single test, suite run, and
  pluggable test discovery? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [x] CHK019 Are alternate flows specified for reruns with identical parameters
  and parameter sweeps? [Coverage, Spec §FR-048, §FR-044]
- [x] CHK020 Are recovery scenarios defined for failed runs or partial suite
  failures? [Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK021 Are all listed edge cases tied to explicit handling requirements?
  [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK022 Are malformed streaming events handled with defined outcomes?
  [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK023 Are rate-limit and transient network failure behaviors specified?
  [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK024 Are performance requirements quantified with thresholds and scope?
  [Measurability, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements (Precision Controls)]
- [x] CHK025 Are security requirements explicit for secrets redaction and access
  control? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005, §NFR-002]
- [x] CHK026 Are observability requirements clear for logs/metrics tags and
  expected fields? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-005]
- [x] CHK027 Are determinism requirements specified with a clear policy for
  stochastic outputs? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-004]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK028 Are external dependency assumptions (OpenAI-compatible, Ollama)
  explicitly documented with compatibility expectations? [Assumption,
  Spec §FR-001..FR-002]
- [x] CHK029 Is the local-only execution assumption documented for API/CLI
  usage? [Assumption, Spec §CLI + API (for automation)]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK030 Are any terms like "fast", "robust", or "compatible" quantified
  with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements (Precision Controls)]
- [x] CHK031 Are there conflicting requirements between profile defaults and
  test-level overrides? [Conflict, Spec §FR-038..FR-040, §FR-059]

## Traceability

- [x] CHK032 Is there an explicit ID scheme tying requirements to tasks and
  acceptance criteria? [Traceability, Gap]
