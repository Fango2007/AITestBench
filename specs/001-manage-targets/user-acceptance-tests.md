| UAT-02 | Prevent creating a target when required fields are missing. | Create target form validation (Name, Base URL, Create button). | Leave Name empty, fill Base URL, click Create; then leave Base URL empty and attempt Create. | Name: `(empty)`, Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/v1` (first attempt). | Target is not created; no new entry appears in the list. |
| UAT-03 | Edit target details and persist changes. | Active targets list, Edit action, Edit target form (Name, Provider, Auth token env var, Save). | In Active targets, click Edit on a target, change Name, Provider, and Auth token env var, click Save. | Existing target: `Local OpenAI Dev`; New Name: `Local OpenAI Dev v2`; Provider: `Auto (try both)`; Auth token env var: `AITESTBENCH_API_TOKEN`. | Target list updates with the new name; inspector shows updated Provider and Auth token ref. |
| UAT-04 | Archive an active target. | Active targets list, Archive action. | Click Archive on an active target. | Target: `Local OpenAI Dev v2`. | Target disappears from "Active targets" and appears in "Archived targets". |

| UAT-06 | Inspect target details and models. | Active targets list, Inspect action, Target inspector panel. | Click Inspect on a target. | Target with models populated (if available), e.g., `Local Ollama` at `http://localhost:11434`. | Target inspector shows name, base URL, connectivity status, provider, and model list; selected list item is highlighted. |
| UAT-07 | Retry connectivity for a failed target. | Targets list, Retry action (only on failed targets). | Ensure a target has failed connectivity, then click Retry. | Target: `Unreachable Target`, Base URL: `http://localhost:9999`. | Connectivity status updates after refresh (failed->ok if target becomes reachable, or a new last check timestamp if still failing). |
| UAT-08 | Run a single test against a target. | Run Single page, Target selector, Tests multi-select, Run button. | Navigate to Run Single, select a target, select one test, click Run. | Target: `Local OpenAI Dev`; Test ID: choose one from the list (e.g., `perplexity-proxy` if present). | Result card appears with JSON for the run. |
| UAT-09 | Run multiple tests as an ad-hoc suite. | Run Single page, Tests multi-select, Run button. | Select a target, select two or more tests, click Run. | Target: `Local OpenAI Dev`; Test IDs: choose any two from the list. | A run is created for an ad-hoc suite; Result card appears with JSON for the run. |
