## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Inference server management from the dashboard, including create, edit, archive, and runtime/discovery refresh flows.
- Test template management for JSON and Python-backed templates.
- Run execution, result browsing, and the results dashboard with filters, graphs, and tables.
- Local SQLite persistence, profile support, and API endpoints for runs, results, models, suites, profiles, templates, and system settings.
- CI and GitHub release workflow definitions for validating and publishing tagged releases.

### Changed

- Standardized the default backend port on `8080` so the backend, frontend, Playwright config, and documentation align out of the box.
- Added production-oriented `build` and `start` scripts for the backend and frontend workspaces.
- Excluded the CLI from the `0.1.0` public release surface.
